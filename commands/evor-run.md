description: Load the active mission and launch the Evor tick loop

# /evor-run

This command loads the active mission and starts (or resumes) the Evor tick loop.

## Dispatch

1. Read the bundled skill instructions with one deterministic read:
   ```bash
   cat "${EVOR_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/evor-run/SKILL.md"
   ```
   `EVOR_PLUGIN_ROOT` is exported by this plugin’s SessionStart hook and `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` by Claude Code — either points at the plugin’s install directory, so this resolves regardless of your current working directory.
2. Follow that SKILL.md exactly, treating the user's arguments as:

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

If `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` happens to be unset, fall back to a **bounded** lookup only:

```bash
find "$HOME/.claude/plugins" -path "*oh-my-evor*/skills/evor-run/SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

**Never run `find /` or scan the whole filesystem.** The skill lives inside this plugin's own directory; a full-disk search is unnecessary and will hang the session.

## Quick Reference

- Usage: `/evor-run [mission-id or run-id]`
- If no argument given, reads `.evor/active-run.json` for the current run
- If no mission is set up, redirects to `/evor-setup`
- Detects existing runs automatically and offers to resume
